text="The Mod Matrix is where you
would set up modulation for
mono and poly MIDI modes.

MONO MODE:
-Setting things using the
Voice modulator will affect
all channels/layers

POLY MODE:
-Setting things using the
Voice modulator will affect
all incoming MIDI channels
and their directed targets.

eg: Setting a source of
CC7 to [Voice Amplitude] will
make it so that MIDI CH4 will
affect SNES Channel 4.

VOICE MODULATORS:
For modulators that are not
in the voice sub-menu, you
will need to set it up on a
per-channel basis.

When I created Presets for
chipsynth SFC, it came with a
bunch of Poly-Timbral presets
that you can use to not have
to spend a lot of time setting
general MIDI controllers up.

Feel free to use them! :)

DELAY MODULATORS:
Due to the needed compatibility
with chipcrusher v2, it is not
currently possible to modulate
most of the Echo/Delay settings
at this time.

VOLUME MODULATORS:
It's best to use the Scaled
math setting for volume
commands so that they scale
in proportion to other volume
commands.
